# CPP Study Space 👨🏻‍💻

Basic sample codes are written by c++ 👨🏻‍💻

Coding is not just a writing code for programs! So, I improved to build process after section `004.Functions`

src directory is for source codes
bin directory is for compile outputs
dist directory is for binary distribution

Sample section directory structure:

```

src\
    main.cpp
    lib\
        logic_a\ 
            logic_a.h
            logic_a.cpp
        logic_b\ 
            logic_b.h
            logic_b.cpp
bin\
    program.bin 
    main.bin
    lib\
        logic_a.bin
        logic_b.bin
Readme.md
makefile
...

```
